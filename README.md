Summarize your goals, non-goals, and project requirements from your design doc. Make sure to link your design doc here as well.



Sprint Goal
- Have the program be able to compile a list of words based on given word lengths and letters for game levels WITHOUT duplicate letters
- Have the program use the list of words to guess letters by finding the location of letters and interacting with the mouse of the computer
- If both these goals have been completed, go back and attempt to make the program able to compile a list of words based on given word lengths and letters for game levels WITH duplicate letters
- Clean up code/make it look nicer and be easier to read
